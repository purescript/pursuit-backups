This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision isn't registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision isn't properly configured.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed</code> – A <code>RequestCancelActivityTask</code> decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StartTimerFailed</code> – A <code>StartTimer</code> decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CancelTimerFailed</code> – A <code>CancelTimer</code> decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed</code> – A <code>StartChildWorkflowExecution</code> decision failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified isn't registered, is deprecated, or the decision isn't properly configured.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed</code> – A <code>SignalExternalWorkflowExecution</code> decision failed.

An <code>UnhandledDecision</code> fault is returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call <a>RespondDecisionTaskCompleted</a> without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution.</p> </note> <p> <b>How to Code a Decision</b> </p> <p>You code a decision by first setting the decision type
